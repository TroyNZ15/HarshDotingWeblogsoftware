      <p>After the completion and finalisation of the Poly Character. The design would of been incorporated into a video game.</p>
    <p>The End Users, the players of the game themselves would be able to use this character as an avatar. These people are consumers of gaming products and are active gamers who usually spend a large amount of their free time towards video game.</p>
    <p>They like want from the poly character a good design and something that looks good.</p>
    <p>They need to have characters inorder for them to play the game, another need would be the need to diversify the amount of characters to distingush players.</p>
    <p>A want would be the ablility to customise such characters.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Writing part -->
  <div class="BOX3">
<ul><li>Head</li></ul>
    <p>The head has to be a realistic shape, meaning showing the oval head shape of the Elvish Archer, a sharp kaw line, and the hood to cover the top part of his face. </p>
    <ul><li>Arms</li></ul>
    <p>The arms would be bulky because of the padded armour, mosty the shoulders. Going down the arm we see the topper part of the forearm to be quite skinny and bulky hands, because of the armour. The character also have to have mobing elboes when it does specific movements.</p>
    <ul><li>Legs</li></ul>
<p>The legs have to be, in modersation to the arms, quite big. It will appear to be quite muscular. He will also have big calves and big shoes to help with all his tactical maneuvers.</p>
    <ul><li>Torso/Chest</li></ul>
    <p>The waist on the character has to be wide, he'll have a big rest that will pop out noticely from a side angle. He'll have a decently thick neck. The Waist will be roughly the same size as the legs in width.</p>
    <ul><li>The Quiver</li></ul>
    <p>The Quiver will be and attached to the Archer's back at all times. He will have many arrows stored in the Quiver.</p>
    <ul><li>The Belt</li></ul>
    <p>The belt will be attached to the waist of the character and will be in place for the purpose of keeping the hold piece of clothing intact while in battle for instance. This allows for the baggy clothing to not get int the way of his fighting.</p>
    <ul><li>Gloves</li></ul>
    <p>The left hand of the Archer will be a thick leather based glove. This is because of all the friction in the left hand caused by many maneuvers. The right hand wouldn't have the glove however to allow for careful aimly of the arims that would be fired.</p>

  <h1 class="heading">Aesthetics</h1>

  <div class="BOX4">
Aesthetics is about how something looks and feels. This is important for my low-poly character because how it looks could be the factor that makes people want to play the game, or not. The movement of the character is also very important because it needs to feel good for people to want to keep playing.

   <h1 class="heading">Functionality</h1>
  <div class="BOX4">
<p>Usability is about how well you can use something, and the experience when doing so. This is important for my low-poly character because how something work, and how easy it is to control it, is directly correlated to the users experience playing the game, and understanding the controls and overall mechanics of the game.</p>

  <div class="BOX4">
<p>Intellectual property is about creations of our own mind, and what is our, and ours only. For example making a painting is intellectual property because that painting is created by a human being and therefore is under the ownership of that human if they would prefer it that way.</p>

<h2>Poly Character</h2>
  <p>28/03/2024</p>
  <p>Today I uploaded by diagram of my Elvish Archer onto blencher and started to create the torso of the character. I did these and started to work on the arms of the character.</p>

  <h2>1.Torso</h2>
<p>To design the torso I added a cube, deleted half of it, then mirrored it to create the base of the torso.I then added loop cuts to create more vertices which I used to shape the torso to how I designed its shape.</p>

  <h2>Testing</h2>
<p>My torso from different angles seemed to be a little blockly and didn't have the appearence I wanted.</p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

  <p>How do you feel about the proportions of the torso?</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>" I think the sizing of the chest to the abdomen seems in proportion and I can see how the neck and arms will fit. Perhaps the collarbone should be slightly smaller though."</p>
  <p>" They look good. I can tell this is a human torso."</p>
